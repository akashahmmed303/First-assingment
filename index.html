                <p class="gray"> Shelter is a basic human need crucial for survival in cases of natural hazards or
                    conflict. It provides security, personal safety and protection from the weather, and prevents ill
                    health and disease. Adequate housing provides people with dignity and the opportunity to lead a
                    normal life.

            <p class="suv-p">Healthy ecosystems clean our water, purify our air, maintain our soil, regulate the
                climate, recycle
                nutrients and provide us with food. They provide raw materials and resources for medicines and other
                purposes. They are at the foundation of all civilisation and sustain our economies. It's that simple: we
                could not live without these “ecosystem services”. They are what we call our natural capital.</p>
